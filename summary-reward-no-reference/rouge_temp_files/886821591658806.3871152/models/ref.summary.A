A German man who had his penis enlarged with silicone injections claims it now weighs half a stone. Micha stunz , has a 9 inch-long , 3.5 inch penis that now weighs between 7.5 - 9.5 lbs , between 3 and 4.3 kg , he says. ` I ca n't say exactly how much it weighs , I just know that my kitchen scale , which shows up to 6.6 lb , has n't been enough for a while , ' he told Vice.com. Mr Stunz , 45 , who lives in Berlin , said he had his penis permanently enlarged in this way , not because it makes him feel more beautiful , but because it makes him feel ` better '. Micha Stunz , 45 , has permanently enlarged his penis with silicone injections. It is now 9 inches long and weighs up to 9.5 lbs ( 4.3 kg ) , he claims. He uses his Satchel to cover up his groin area when he is in public. ` I 'm actually a pretty shy person , ' he said. Curiously , the silicone implants provide no physical pleasure and actually make sex much more difficult for him - although it is not impossible. He can not get a normal erection - and any increase in size is not visible due to all the silicone. But although his giant penis restricts his sex life , he says it makes him more creative in the bedroom. He told Vice : ` after you reach a certain size , you ca n't do certain things any more. ` At least not with everyone and not without some foreplay. But there are other things you can do with it. You just have to free yourself from established roles and ideas about sex and be ready to play. ' Mr STUNZ 's interest in penis modification 20 years ago , when he was given a pump as a present. ` I was way too curious not to try it out. First , I tried it secretly for myself , ' he said. ` and I found that when I went out pumped up , it was a good feeling , it felt great. ' Mr stunz 's interest in penis modifications were piqued when he was given a penis pump at 20-years-old and found it felt ' great '. He moved on to saline injections before opting for the more permanent silicone ones. ` I had the feeling that I was n't trapped in the body I was born with , but that I had the possibility to shape it myself to change it. ' He then began enlarging himself with saline injections. ` the feeling was great , ' he said , ` but I did n't like getting the injections - There 's always a risk of infection. ` and also the people around me started to wonder why my groin area would change in size. ` That 's why I started looking for something more permanent. ' It took him several years to find out about silicone injections , which were only available in London when he first began researching them. However , rather than seeking professional medical help , he met a medical student who agreed to perform the first injections. To date , MR STUNZ has had four procedures which involved injecting silicone into his penis and scrotum. However , Dr Aref El Seweife , a urologist in Berlin who carries out penis enlargements , warns that an injecting silicon into the penis can lead to an infection that will leave it ` mutilated '. ` In worst cases , it can lead to an enlarged artery in the scrotum and the testicles die , ' he told Vice Journalists , urging people who opt for the procedure to have it done by a medical professional. In fact , a 2012 study in the urology annals , said : ` We conclude that penile enhancement procedures with liquid silicone by non-medical personnel could result in devastating consequences. ' Mr stunz said he uses a Satchel to cover his modesty and refrains from telling certain people - such as his boss or his extended relations - about his enlarged penis. Mr stunz accepts this advice , and agrees that others thinking of having their penis enlarged with silicone should make sure they are fully informed. While his situation might seem extreme , he claims he leads a ` normal life '. He said : ` I go to work , buy groceries , go to bars , clubs , and to the movies. I usually try to make sure it is n't too obvious. But I guess it is n't easy buying a new pair of pants. ' Penis size has been a source of anxiety for men throughout history - and this concern has been found to transcend ethnicity and cultural barriers. Sadhus , holy men of India and male of Cholomec tribe in Peru used weights to increase their penile lengths. Males of the Dayak tribe in Borneo resorted to self mutilation by forming holes on their penises and then sticking decorative items through them for their partner 's pleasure. Brazilians of the Topinama tribe allowed poisonous snakes to bite their penises in order to enlarge them. Men In some areas of Indonesia , the Philippines , Thailand , and Malaysia have a long history of inserting or implanting various objects in their penises. Several documented papers have described how ' The bigger the better ' mantra has been the motto for more than a century - and being too small is still regarded as very humiliating in many cultures. These stigmas of apparently small penises , as well as the increasing influence of the media on sexual issues , have increased the demand for penile enhancements , figures show. However the majority of men who request penile enhancement surgery usually have a normally sized and normally functioning penis , doctors say. These patients interpret normal appearances as abnormal , and as such are distressed and depressed. Source : Urology Annals. He also prefers to urinate sitting down in a cubicle as he attracts odd looks when using urinals. While sometimes he says he is pleased to get so much attention , at other points he hides his modesty. He uses a Satchel bag to ` hide his bulge ' and refrains from telling some people in his life about his physical appearance. ` there are definitely situations when I say `` the other person does n't need to know right now ''. When it 's the boss or all the extended relations , then I 'll tell a white lie. ` I 'm actually a pretty shy person , ' he explains , while leather-clad at a bondage festival. Indeed , one of his favourite events of the year is the FOLSOM Europe Festival - a bondage , fetish and Latex affair in Berlin. When he attends the carnival , he wears a specially-made pair of latex pants to show off his huge penis. Speaking of why he loves the event , he said : ` You can offer up who you are and show yourself the way you want without having to think about what other people will think of you. ' He sometimes worries that potential partners are only interested in him for his manhood. He said : ` You get reduced to the bulge obviously. There 's always that danger in the relationship. ` But if you take the time to get to know the other person , you find out whether he really loves you or just a part of you. ' Ultimately , MR stunz believed the interest in his penis modification belies deep-rooted sexism. ` If some woman gets breast enlargements , nobody says anything about it , ' he said. ` If a man does something very similar to his body , it 's worth making a documentary about it because it 's so extraordinary. ` I hope that changes soon because the difference really is n't that big. ' Mr Stunz said the silicone implants make sex much more difficult , although it is not impossible.
