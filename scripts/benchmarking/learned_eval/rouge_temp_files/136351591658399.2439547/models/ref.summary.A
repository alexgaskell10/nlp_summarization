It was one of Barcelona 's easier nights in the Champions League as Luis Enrique 's team brushed aside Paris saint-germain 2-0 at the Nou camp to reach the semi-finals. The 5-1 aggregate victory never looked in doubt as the Spanish side showed signs of returning to their brilliant best , with a combination of experienced stars and blossoming talent in their ranks. Here sportsmail looks at the five things we have learned from Barca 's crushing victory over PSG. Neymar ( left ) celebrates opening the scoring for Barcelona along with Dani Alves ( centre ) and Gerard Pique. Neymar is a blend of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi. He 's just a child , said Juliano Belletti in the week. Some child. Let 's not go overboard ; there 's no way of knowing whether Neymar will reach both the level and consistency of Ronaldo or Messi. But his skill-set and talents seem a combination of those two players , which means he has the potential to be very dangerous indeed. Neymar chases for the ball during the win against Paris Saint Germain in the Champions League quarter-final. Neymar has the blend of Cristiano Ronaldo ( left ) and Lionel Messi in his skillset. Neymar has MESSI 's close control when dribbling , he has the flair which Cristiano used to display as a badge of pride - and winds up opponents in the same way. Both the Real Madrid and Barcelona legends are lethal finishers and Neymar is getting there , as he showed here. There are still parts of his game which he has to improve ; his crossing and final pass sometimes leave a little to be desired. But he is in the right place to hone his skills and barring injury , he will be on the Ballon d'Or podium sooner , rather than later. Luis Enrique has strong chance of matching pep Guardiola 's treble-winning debut season. Barcelona look like genuine treble contenders. They are in the Copa Del Rey final , against Athletic Bilbao. They have a two-point lead in La Liga and only six games remain. And three more victories in the Champions League would see them lift the trophy for the fifth time in their history. There are tough games to come ; none of the semi-finalists will be pushovers. But the brutal way they dismantled a PSG side that knocked out Chelsea , the English champions-in-waiting , in the previous round , shows the level they are at right now. Luis Enrique Celebrates with his coaching staff after Neymar 's opening goal at the Nou camp. They have gone from winning nothing last year to being on the cusp of emulating pep Guardiola 's treble-winning first season. There 's life in the old dog yet. Lot of reasons have been given for why Andres INIESTA has n't been at his best over the past couple of years. The most recent is that Barcelona 's new style of play has n't allowed him to flourish. He 's having to play in a deeper role , to allow Neymar more space on the left , and offer a bit more protection in a side that features three totally attack-minded forwards. Andres INIESTA charges at the PSG defence for Barcelona as the Spaniard played close to his best. But it was from deep that INIESTA started his run , shimmying away from Edinson Cavani , beating two more PSG players for pace and then feeding in Neymar , who scored , killing the tie. INIESTA may still be acclimatising to the new methods at Barcelona and changes to the way he has played the game for the past decade , but his immense talent will find a way to adapt. PSG project needs more investment - as long as it 's sensible investment. Having been knocked out of the Champions League 5-1 on aggregate by Barcelona , it 's easily believable that PSG chief Nasser al-khelaifi will ready the big bucks to bring a new World Star to the club in the summer. Edinson Cavani stands dejected for PSG during the second leg defeat at the Nou camp. Cavani goes to ground on the touchline in front of PSG boss Laurent Blanc. That really is n't what they need. Bringing another big name into the mix wo n't be helpful ; they need to build a squad. They need to sign players appropriate for positions , rather than trying to crowbar stars into the side. Edinson Cavani is a good example. He was a brilliant centre-forward , right now he 's low on confidence and an ineffective foil for Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Sign , by all means , but sign smart. Barcelona 's big guns blowing apart the landscape. Perhaps then , it was n't helpful for PSG to see the potency of Barcelona 's attacking trio first hand. It took a bit of sculpting , with Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez switching places , but now the terrifying trio up front are flying. Luis Suarez ( left ) Neymar ( centre ) and Lionel Messi celebrate a goal against Atletico Madrid in January. They 're on course to record the highest goal tally for a Barcelona front-line in the past decade. Back in 2011-12 the Messi , CESC FABREGAS and Alexis Sanchez attack managed 101 - including 75 from MESSI himself. So far this season Messi , Neymar and Suarez have 95 in all competitions. And if they reach the Champions League final , they have 10 games in which to do it.
